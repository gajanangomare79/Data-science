    "**Objective** <br />\n",
    ">The primary goal of this assignment is for students to begin creation of a Jupyter Notebook \"template\" that can be re-used and repurposed in future Machine Learning endeavors.  Questions in this assignment are geared towards tasks that will require the build-out of important data exploration and data clean-up functionality - functionality that will be used repeatedly in the future.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions** <br />\n",
    ">Answer all questions below.  Some questions are conceptual and will require answers to be typed out in markdown cells.  Other questions will require successful creation and running of Python code using various libraries discussed in class and in the book.  Remember!  If you don't know how to do something in Python, Google \"how do I [do this thing] in Python.\"  I promised you will find answers and examples to try out.  This is an important part of the learning process.  If, you get really stuck on anything, feel free to reach out to me or our TA (Shreeshiv) for help.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**Note**: any datasets required in the questions below can be found in the course data folder (link is on our Canvas home page)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning** <br />\n",
    ">I have no clear way to \"Police\" your work or your integrity.  In short, I expect your work to be YOUR WORK.  That said, in principle, I don't have a problem with classmates trying to figure things out together.  But if you happen to see a code snippet from a fellow classmate that you decide to include in your code - MAKE IT YOUR OWN!.  How?  With documentation.  I expect you to do the same if you copy and re-use code from some stranger on Stackoverflow.  Make sure you know what the code is doing and prove that you do with documentation and comments in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverables** <br />\n",
    ">1. Before midnight on the due date, submit ONE Jupyter Notebook file (the file should looking something like this - \"**MyAssignment1Notebook.ipynb**\").  Submit this file through the assignment page in Canvas.  I repeat - ONE Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "<br><br>Immediately following the due date/time you will receive an email containing the homework answers/solutions.  Spend some time over the next few days comparing your work to what you see in the solution.<br><br>\n",
    "2. **PRIOR** to the assignment of your next homework, submit an updated version of your original Jupyter Notebook, this time containing a brief assessment of your self-evaluation.  You can type this in markdown at the bottom of your Jupyter Notebook.\n",
